## ABOUT

Welcome! This app was built for a non-profit to better organize their silent
auction. The app allows users to create an account and then donate items to the
auction. As an admin, they are able to view a list of all of the users, items,
and see which items have been archived by users. Admins are also able to do all
of the basic CRUD functionality for an item, as well as download a CSV of all
the donations.
